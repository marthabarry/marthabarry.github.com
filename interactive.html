 <h1> Proposal for Interactive Website</h1>
 <h2> A travel experience</h2>
</header>
<p> For my intereactive website, I would like to create an interactive journal for my upcoming 2 week trip to the Netherlands.
After looking at many interactive website examples posted to our google group, I found one example particularly inspiring. The website
for the firm <a id="black" href="http://www.blacknegative.com/#!/whoweare/">Blacknegative</a> is a great example of my design aesthetic in an interesting
and interactive setting. They did an amazing job refining the interactivity so it feels intuitive and natural. Everything is smooth and creates
a feeling of style and ease. This level of refined interactivity is what I would like to create in my site. For my site I would like to create
an interactive journal or sketchbook that conveys the experience I had in each place I visited.</p>

<p> To create this interactive journal/sketchbook, I would like the base of the site to be a map of the Netherlands. From there, I would create a "pinpoint"
on each place I visited. When the user scrolls over the "pinpoint" a bubble would pop up with either text, an image, a song or sound recording, or a short movie.
The user would also be able to click open that bubble so that they can view the bubbles contents larger. I am still trying to work out whether the map would take place
in a particular city or over the entire country of the Netherlands. I will be in Amsterdam for 8 days, so I am leaning towards making the site solely about Amsterdam. 
I think this simple refined interactivity would give the user a visual insight into the city and also into how I view the world.</p>
